DNA Codon-Pair Bias Sequence Analysis Program

Just make to compile all programs.
There are four programs:

orf: the program to recognize orf and generate information about codon and codon pairs.

partition: partition one file with many genomes into files each with only one genome within it.

count: count the number of genomes in the file to facilitate the download.

reverse: generate reverse complementary sequence.
